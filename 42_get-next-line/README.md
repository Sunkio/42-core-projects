## Project Description
For this project, I created a C function that is similar to getline() in that it reads text from a file descriptor line by line.
It returns the text to the standard output. When there is nothing more to read, get_next_line() returns "null".

## How to use it
Pretty straight forward: Include the header file get_next_line.h in your file and use the function to your liking.
