## Project Description
This was my very first project as a student at 42. The task was to create my own library of C functions that I'm allowed to reuse in most of my other projects throughout the whole curriculum.

My library consists of 42 functions, most of them are recoded functions from the C standard library, plus some other utility functions that will come in handy later on during my studies.

## How to use it 
- "make" at the root of the repository creates the library of the mandatory part of the project.
- "make bonus" at the root of the repository creates the library including the bonus part which consists of linked lists utility functions.
